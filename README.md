# LeetCode Solutions

This repo contains all my working and ongoing solutions to LeetCode problems.  


I came into this with some coding experience already, so I primarily focus on solving **Medium** problems, with some **Easy** problems for practice, and **Hard** problems that seem doable. I have been solving these [300 curated LeetCode Problems](https://algomaster.io/practice/dsa-patterns) by section, which has been very helpful in navigating LeetCode.


---------------
I currently solve them in **Java**, but aim to spread my horizons to **Python** and **C++** in the future.

Here is my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/u/Mutms7/), displaying my activity, solved problems, and ranking.


## Structure
Solutions are organized by question difficulty:
- [Easy Questions](./Leetcode/src/aEasyQuestions.java) (Many are not saved on VS Code, as I solved them quite quickly and submitted solutions to LeetCode)
- [Medium Questions](./Leetcode/src/aMediumQuestions.java)
- [Hard Questions](./Leetcode/src/aHardQuestions.java)

In each file, solutions are static methods with a note indicating the LeetCode problem number and the solution status. 

E.g. "P100 OK" is solved, "P200 NO" is not.

## Goals
- Develop better problem-solving skills
- Improve my ability to implement ideas into code
- Present solutions in a clear, clean manner
- Minimize the usage of the Solutions tab and video tutorials
- Solve 5 problems per week
